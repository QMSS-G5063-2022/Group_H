# Project Title: Fashion Trend Visualization


### Brief Description of the project
### Abstract: The project seeks to understand characteristics of clothing trends based on apparel offered on popular e-commerce sites. The data collected provides site categorizations of products up for sale such as main categories (Apparel, Accessories, etc.), subcategories (Top, Shoes, etc.), article type (T-shirts, Handbags, etc.), and other descriptives such as color, usage, year, and season. The visualizations that are planned to be produced are seasonality of color, yearly trends in categories, and clothing usage in various categories. We would also like to explore how clothing usage and article type may trend differently between male and female consumers.

How does baseColour differ from season to season and year to year? 
How has the trend in certain subCategory changed over time?
Frequently purchased brand over years for male and female?
Number of item change in a certain subCategory over the years

Techniques: ggplot2, NLP text analysis, interaction

The dataset is from 2010-2018, with 31136 unique values of various apparel, accessories, footwear, and in some cases personal care - all products that are sold by big name fashion brands. Cataloged products were scraped from e-commerce websites and organized into columns and categories as described below. This dataset can give us a unique insight into fashion trends from 2010-2018.

baseColour: color of the product
