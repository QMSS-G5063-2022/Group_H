# Project Title: Fashion Trend Visualization


### Brief Description of the project
#### Abstract: The project seeks to understand characteristics of clothing trends based on apparel offered on popular e-commerce sites. The data collected provides site categorizations of products up for sale such as main categories (Apparel, Accessories, etc.), subcategories (Top, Shoes, etc.), article type (T-shirts, Handbags, etc.), and other descriptives such as color, usage, year, and season. The visualizations that are planned to be produced are seasonality of color, yearly trends in categories, and clothing usage in various categories. We would also like to explore how clothing usage and article type may trend differently between male and female consumers.
